# OpenPond Improvement Proposals (OIPs)

OpenPond Improvement Proposals (OIPs) are the primary mechanism for proposing changes to the OpenPond Protocol. This includes new features, protocol updates, or process improvements.

## Types of OIPs

   - Get early feedback from the community
   - Refine the proposal based on feedback

2. **Draft OIP**

   - Use the standard template
   - Include technical specifications
   - Address security considerations

3. **Review**

   - Technical review by core developers
   - Community feedback period
   - Iterate based on feedback

4. **Final**
   - Acceptance or rejection
   - Implementation if accepted
